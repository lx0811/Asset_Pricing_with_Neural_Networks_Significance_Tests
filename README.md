## Description of folders     

1. code includes:

    build_nn_model.py, initializes and compiles a NN model.

    discretization.py, generates tau_h^(max) samples for X data.

    test_statistics.py, calculates gradients and tstats of variables.

    test_variable_significance.py, identifies significant variables, calculates p-values and significance frequenies.

    reproduce_results.py, produces Table 2, Figure 2, and Figure 3 from data uploaded.

2. data includes:

    test statstics and scaled tau_h^(max) samples for the training set.

    scaled tau_h^(max) = tau_h^(max)*U(C',Ïµ_n)^2, see Theorem 3.2.3 in paper.

3. output includes:

    .csv and figures produced by reproduce_results.py.
